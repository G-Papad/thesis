We presented AQQUA, a decentralized private and auditable payment system. 
Our accounts extend Quisquis accounts in order to record (in hidden form) the total influx and outflux.
While we introduce two authorities in AQQUA, it remains decentralized since the $\RA$ and $\AA$ do not intervene in the normal flow of transactions.
A major direction for possible future research involves strengthening the privacy provided by AQQUA even more.
Firstly, the fact that the audit proofs leak account information between the audit states could be addressed. 
Secondly, another direction could be to convert audit proofs to be designated-verifier \cite{DVP} \cite{DBLP:conf/cai/UDVLRS}, \cite{BGKPS}.
As a result, the $\AA$ will be able to simulate them, and thus it will be the only entity convinced about the audit results. 
This may increase the privacy of the participants, but it will interfere with the trust dynamics of the system. 
As a result, further research is needed for this integration.
