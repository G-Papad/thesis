\subsection{Comparison}

Of the three private systems mentioned above, Zerocash offers full anonymity, while the other two offer set anonymity. However, both Zerocash and Monero suffer from a very important limitation. This is the size of the storage cost that each miner must maintain in the system. Since a UTXO input is not identified when spent (to preserve anonymity), these two systems have a growing list of UTXOs. This fact prevents miners from storing a concise version of the blockchain. The primitive updatable public keys used by Quisquis provide a solution to this problem. As a result, Quisquis manages to maintain a constant storage cost with respect to the number of transactions.
