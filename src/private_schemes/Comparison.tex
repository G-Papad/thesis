\subsection{Comparison}

Among the three private systems mentioned above, Zerocash offers full anonymity, while the other two offer set anonymity. However, both Zerocash and Monero suffer from a very important limitation. That is the size of storage cost that each miner should maintain in the system. Since a UTXO input is not identified when spent (to preserve anonymity) these two system have a growing list of UTXOs. This fact prevents miners from storing a concise version of the blockchain. Updatable Public Keys primitive, that Quisquis uses, offer a solution to this problem. As a result, Quisquis manage to maintain a constant storage cost with respect to the number of transactions.
