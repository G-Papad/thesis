% \section{Auditability in Private Payment Systems}

Auditability plays a key role in ensuring payment system integrity, transparency and compliance. 
In financial transactions where trust and security are paramount, auditability provides critical protection against fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities.
These regulatory functions that appear in the literature can be categorized in transaction and user level.\\
On the transaction level regulatory functions can include data such as: 
\emph{value limits} (e.g. a threshold in the transfer amount), 
\emph{tracing tags}, that provide links between transactions,
\emph{revealing the transaction value and/or participants},
\emph{tax rate}, deducting a transaction's value portion towards a pre-determined account.\\
On the user level regulatory functions can include:
\emph{information of user's sum of values} (e.g. total amount of funds received/spent in a specific period of time),
\emph{user revocation}, meaning that specific policies are applied only to users in a "blacklist",
\emph{deriving statistical information} (e.g. learning th average transacted value in a time from user's past transactions),
\emph{revoking a non compliant user's anonymity}.

There are two approaches in order these regulation to be enforced, \emph{auditability} and \emph{accountability}.
On the one hand, auditability refers to a protocol where an external auditor can learn the requested information through the data that are stored on the blockchain.
This protocol could be either interactive with the users, meaning their consent is required, or non-interactive.
On the other hand, accountability refers to the recurrent execution of policies by system functions when certain predicate is met.
In other words, transactions that do not comply with the system's policies are never verified and stored in the blockchain.
Therefore, there is no need for active participation of an external auditor, as policies are enforced during the verification phase of the transaction. 

Then, an overview of existing distributed payment systems that combine both privacy and auditability is presented.
Following the structure of \cite{SokAuditability}, these systems are divided into two categories depending on the power given to auditors from the disclosed information:
There are systems that requires a centralized trusted desingated athority to perform the regulation functions and the systems that does not assume any explicit auditor.
