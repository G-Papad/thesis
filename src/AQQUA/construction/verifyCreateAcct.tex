The $\vercreateAcct(\txnca, \state)$ algorithm guarantees the validity of transaction $\txnca$. First, it checks that all the $\userinfo$ listed in $\txnca.\inputs$ are registered and compliant in the current state, meaning for each $\userinfo \in \txnca.\inputs, \userinfo \in \usersset$. Afterwards, it executes the verification algorithm for the NIZK argument $\pi$ and returns its result.
