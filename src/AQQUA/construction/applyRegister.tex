The $\applyreg(\userinfo, \acct, \state)$ algorithm runs after the registration verification and adds a new record to the $\usersset$ containing the $\userinfo$ as well as a new record to the $\utxoset$ containing the newly created account $\acct$. 

%Then it broadcast the new state $\state'$ as well as the registration information $(\userinfo, \acct, \pi)$ to the miners in order to be able to verify the new state.
