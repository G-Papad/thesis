abstract = {Bitcoin exchanges function like banks, securely holding customers' bitcoins on their behalf. Several exchanges have suffered catastrophic losses with customers permanently losing their savings. A proof of solvency demonstrates cryptographically that the exchange controls sufficient reserves to settle each customer's account. We introduce Provisions, a privacy-preserving proof of solvency whereby an exchange does not have to disclose its Bitcoin addresses; total holdings or liabilities; or any information about its customers. We also propose an extension which prevents exchanges from colluding to cover for each other's losses. We have implemented Provisions and it offers practical computation times and proof sizes even for a large Bitcoin exchange with millions of customers.},

abstract="Mix-nets are used in e-voting schemes and other applications that require anonymity. Shuffles of homomorphic encryptions are often used in the construction of mix-nets. A shuffle permutes and re-encrypts a set of ciphertexts, but as the plaintexts are encrypted it is not possible to verify directly whether the shuffle operation was done correctly or not. Therefore, to prove the correctness of a shuffle it is often necessary to use zero-knowledge arguments.",

abstract="For many proofs of knowledge it is important that only the verifier designated by the confirmer can obtain any conviction of the cor- rectness of the proof. A good example of such a situation is for undeniable signatures, where the confirmer of a signature wants to make sure that only the intended verifier(s) in fact can be convinced about the validity or invalidity of the signature.",

abstract="In this work we formalize the notion of a ring signature, which makes it possible to specify a set of possible signers without revealing which member actually produced the signature. Unlike group signatures, ring signatures have no group managers, no setup procedures, no revocation procedures, and no coordination: any user can choose any set of possible signers that includes himself, and sign any message by using his secret key and the others' public keys, without getting their approval or assistance. Ring signatures provide an elegant way to leak authoritative secrets in an anonymous way, to sign casual email in a way that can only be verified by its intended recipient, and to solve other problems in multiparty computations.",
